(This post is quite long, you may want to read it [on Github](https://github.com/LiarPrincess/Swift-forum-rants/tree/main/Subprocess).)

I don't use Swift Concurrency in day-to-day work and I'm not exactly familiar with `fork` internals (I always used wrappers), but for fun I wrote [Vampires and sunglasses](https://github.com/LiarPrincess/Vampires-and-sunglasses). This is basically the [Process from the old Foundation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/process) upgraded to `async/await`. It is very similar to Python [asyncio.subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-subprocess.html). I will refer to some parts of the code later, so just a gist how it works:

```swift
let process = try Subprocess(
  executablePath: "/usr/bin/cat",
  arguments: ["Pride and Prejudice.txt"],
  stdout: .pipe
)

let s = try await process.stdout.readAll(encoding: .utf8)
print(s ?? "<decoding-failed>")

// In 1 expression:
let s2 = try await Subprocess(â€¦).stdout.readAll(encoding: .utf8)
```

This will start the process, read the whole `stdout`, `waitpid` it (in the background) and then close the files. More interesting example would be:

```swift
let process = try Subprocess(executablePath: "/usr/bin/sleep", arguments: ["3"])

Task.detached {
  try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1 * second)
  try await process.kill()
}

let status = try await process.wait()
assert(status == -9)
```

`wait` is just a synchronization point. Cancelling a `Task` that `waits` only cancels this `wait` and does nothing to the process. You can use `process.terminateAfter(body:)` if you need scoped lifetime  - this is exactly the same thing as `fileDescriptor.closeAfter(body:)`. More examples available [here](https://github.com/LiarPrincess/Vampires-and-sunglasses/blob/main/Sources/App/main.swift).

Now let's go back to the proposal.
